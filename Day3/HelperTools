Pylint and Flake8

Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python. It tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells.
It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored,
and can offer you details about the code’s complexity.


Flake8 is a Python library that wraps PyFlakes, pycodestyle and Ned Batchelder’s McCabe script.
It is a great toolkit for checking your code base against coding style (PEP8),
programming errors like “library imported but unused”, “Undefined name” and code which is not indented.


Black   ### https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/auto-format-your-python-code-with-black/

pip install black

Run in terminal
black filename.py
Exact example
black fire_example.py


MyPy

pip install mypy


Why mypy?

Compile-time type checking
Static typing makes it easier to find bugs with less debugging.

Easier maintenance
Type declarations act as machine-checked documentation. Static typing makes your code easier to understand and easier to modify without introducing bugs.

Grow your programs from dynamic to static typing
You can develop programs with dynamic typing and add static typing after your code has matured, or migrate existing Python code to static typing.
